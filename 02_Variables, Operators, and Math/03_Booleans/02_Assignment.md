# ✅ Assignment – Boolean Variables and Java Operators

---

## ✅ Task 1: Use Boolean Operators

```java
public class App {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        boolean isSunny = true;
        boolean isWarm = false;

        // TODO: print "Go outside? "  joined with the correct logical result from isSunny and isWarm
        // TODO: print "Stay in? "  joined with the correct logical result from isSunny and isWarm
    }
}
```

---

## ✅ Task 2: Use Comparison Operators

```java
public class App {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
    
        // Code from Task 1 is here.  
    
        int a = 5, b = 10;

        // TODO: print "Equal? " joined with the appropriate comparison operator of a and b
        // TODO: print "Not Equal? " joined with the appropriate comparison operator of a and b
        // TODO: print "Greater? " joined with the appropriate comparison operator of a and b
        // TODO: print "Less or Equal? " joined with the appropriate comparison operator of a and b
    }
}
```

## ✅ Task 3: Ternary Operator Example

```java
public class App {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
    
        // Code from Tasks 1 and 2 here
    
        int grade = 87;
        // TODO: use the ternary conditional operator to generate a result of type String.  Pass for grades 70 and higher, and Fail otherwise
        // TODO: print result. 
    }
}
```

## ✅ Task 4: Mini Project – Eligibility Checker

```java
public class App {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
    
        // Code from Tasks 1, 2, and 3 here. 
    
        System.out.println("Eligible? " + canVote(20, true));   // true
        System.out.println("Eligible? " + canVote(16, true));   // false
    }
    
    // TODO: create the canVote method that returns a boolean based on whether a person can vote
    // A person can vote if they are 18 or over and they are a citizen.  
}
```
