# 🧪 Day 03 - Java Input, Output, Comments, null, Casting, and Wrapper Classes

## 📘 Assignment 1: Basic Bio Input Program

### 🔧 Instructions:
Write a Java program that:

1. Asks the user for:
   - Name (as a String)
   - Age (as an int)
   - GPA (as a double)

2. Prints the data back out using `System.out.println()`.

3. Cast the GPA to an `int` and print the result.

4. Store the age using a **wrapper class** (`Integer`) and print it.

5. Add at least **two single-line comments** and **one multi-line comment** in your code.

## 💡 Example Output

```
Name: Jordan
Age: 16
GPA: 3.75
Age (wrapped): 16
GPA (approx): 3
Nickname is null? true
```

## 🎯 Bonus Challenge

- Ask the user for a **favorite number (as a string)** and use `Integer.parseInt()` to convert it.
- Use a different wrapper class such as `Double` or `Boolean` in another context.

## ✅ Submission Checklist

- [ ] Used `Scanner` to get user input
- [ ] Printed values with `System.out.println()`
- [ ] Cast a `double` to an `int`
- [ ] Used a wrapper class (e.g., `Integer`)
- [ ] Assigned and checked a `null` reference
- [ ] Used proper comments

## 📝 Reflection

Answer the following after completing your code:

1. What was the most difficult part of this assignment?
2. Why do we use wrapper classes in Java?
3. What’s the difference between implicit and explicit casting?

Submit your `.java` file and answers to the reflection questions.
