# 🧪 Day 04 Assignment – Java Operators and Math Class

## 📘 Task 1: Arithmetic Expression Evaluator

Write a Java program that:

1. Prompts the user for two numbers (use `Scanner`)
2. Calculates and prints:
   - Sum (`+`)
   - Difference (`-`)
   - Product (`*`)
   - Quotient (`/`)
   - Remainder (`%`)
   - Which number is greater using `Math.max()`

### Example Output:
```
Enter first number: 10
Enter second number: 4

Sum: 14
Difference: 6
Product: 40
Quotient: 2
Remainder: 2
Greater number: 10
```

## 📘 Task 2: String Joiner

Write a program that:

1. Prompts for the user’s name and favorite food
2. Concatenates and prints a sentence like:
   ```
   Alex loves pizza!
   ```

Use both `+` and `+=` in your solution.

## 📘 Task 3: Math Power Challenge

1. Prompt the user for a base and exponent.
2. Use `Math.pow()` to raise the base to the power of the exponent.
3. Print the result with a label.

### Example:
```
Enter base: 2
Enter exponent: 4
2^4 = 16.0
```

## ✅ BONUS (Optional Challenge)

- Create a "lucky number" generator using `Math.random()`
- Generate a number between 1 and 100 and display it like this:
  ```
  Your lucky number is: 72
  ```
