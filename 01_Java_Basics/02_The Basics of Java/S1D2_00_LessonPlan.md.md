## 🟠 W - Welcome

**Teacher’s Role:**
- Greet students individually.
- Display the warm-up question on the board:
  > "**Which one do you think Java is more like: a recipe (precise steps) or a LEGO set (build it yourself)?**"
- Students respond on index cards or digital form.
- Take attendance while briefly discussing a few answers.

**Student’s Role:**
- Respond to the warm-up.
- Engage in light discussion.

---

## 🟢 A - Aim

**Teacher’s Role:**
- Post and state the learning objectives clearly:
  > “By the end of class, you will be able to identify Java’s basic program structure, define and use primitive/reference types, and explain the purpose of the `main` method.”

**Why it matters:**
- This foundation is essential for every Java program they will write or debug.

---

## 🟡 R - Review

**Teacher’s Role:**
- Display 3 quick review questions from Day 01:
  1. What is a programming language?
  2. Name one software you use every day.
  3. What do you already know about Java?

**Student’s Role:**
- Respond to each in pairs or on whiteboards.

---

## 🔵 R - Relevant Instruction

**Activity 1: Direct Instruction + Modeling Java Code**  
**Time:** 35 minutes  

**Teacher’s Role:**
- Explain the **basic structure** of a Java program:
  ```java
  public class Main {
      public static void main(String[] args) {
          System.out.println("Hello, world!");
      }
  }
  ```
- Define the terms:
  - `class`, `public`, `static`, `void`, `main`, `String[] args`
- Introduce **primitive types**: `int`, `double`, `char`, `boolean`
- Explain **reference types**: Objects, `String`, and arrays
- Demonstrate code examples:
  ```java
  int age = 17;
  double height = 5.9;
  boolean isStudent = true;
  String name = "Jordan";
  ```
- Create anchor chart or slides with primitive vs reference types comparison
- Check for understanding with 2 verbal response checks:
  - “What’s the difference between `int` and `String`?”
  - “Why do we need `main` in Java?”

**Student’s Role:**
- Take guided notes
- Ask questions during instruction

**Instructional Methods Used:**
- ✅ Mini-lesson/direct instruction  
- ✅ Guided notes  
- ✅ Modeling/demonstration  
- ✅ Anchor chart or visual aid  
- ✅ Partner talk

**Differentiation:**
- ELL students get a handout with key term definitions
- Advanced students write an additional method in their `Main` class

---

## 🟣 I - Interactive

**Activity: Practice Task in IDE (WebStorm, IntelliJ, or Replit)**  
**Time:** 20 minutes  

**Teacher’s Role:**
- Provide a scaffolded code template:
  ```java
  public class AboutMe {
      public static void main(String[] args) {
          // declare your name, age, and one fun fact
      }
  }
  ```
- Circulate and help students run and debug their code

**Student’s Role:**
- Modify the starter code to display their name, age, and a fun fact
- Run the code, fix errors, compare with peers

**Flair/Fun:**
- Call on a few students to run their program on the projector
- Create a "Java Jukebox" if time allows: vote on best fun fact line

---

## 🟤 O - Ownership

**Activity: Exit Challenge**  
**Time:** 10 minutes  

**Task:**
- Add a new variable to their `AboutMe` program (e.g., favorite color)
- Add a comment above each variable explaining its type (primitive or reference)
- Complete 3-question reflection:
  1. Which type was easiest to understand?
  2. What’s one Java term you’re still unsure about?
  3. Rate your comfort level (1–5) with today’s material.

**Differentiation:**
- Struggling students can use a template with blanks
- Advanced students can define a new method that prints their info

---

## 🔴 R - Resonate

**Teacher’s Role:**
- Lead a short group reflection:
  > “What’s one thing about Java that *surprised* you today?”
- Review the Aim and restate how it was met

**Student’s Role:**
- Share out one takeaway
- Ask any lingering questions

---

## 🧰 Supplies

- Projector/slides with code examples  
- Handouts: guided notes, primitive vs reference comparison  
- IDE setup or online compiler (Replit, IntelliJ, etc.)  
- Printed starter code (optional for students without IDEs)  
- Exit ticket handouts or Google Form  

---

## ✅ Differentiation & Support

- **ELL**: Bilingual glossary for new terms, visuals, sentence starters  
- **Struggling students**: Fill-in-the-blank code scaffold  
- **Advanced students**: Extra coding task with method creation
