# Assignment 1: Basic Ternary Practice

## Overview
**Difficulty**: Beginner  
**Estimated Time**: 30-45 minutes  
**Focus**: Simple ternary operations with numbers and strings

This assignment will help you practice the basic syntax and usage of the ternary conditional operator in Java.

---

## Learning Objectives
By completing this assignment, you will be able to:
- Use the ternary operator for simple conditional assignments
- Replace basic if-else statements with ternary operators
- Work with different data types in ternary expressions
- Apply ternary operators in method returns

---

## Instructions

### Setup
1. Create a new Java class called `BasicTernaryPractice`
2. Import any necessary classes (Scanner, etc.)
3. Include proper comments and documentation

### Tasks

#### Task 1: Number Comparisons
Create a method called `findMaximum` that:
- Takes two integers as parameters
- Uses a ternary operator to return the larger number
- Test it in your main method with different number pairs

**Template:**
```java
public static int findMaximum(int a, int b) {
    // TODO: Use ternary operator to return the maximum
}
```

**Test in main method:**
```java
System.out.println("Max of 15 and 23: " + findMaximum(15, 23));
System.out.println("Max of 100 and 50: " + findMaximum(100, 50));
System.out.println("Max of -5 and -10: " + findMaximum(-5, -10));
```
